# VBScript_codes
Miscellaneous VBScript codes to make life easier in Windows environment

### _TEMPLATE.vbs

A simple script template file which works as a starting point.

### filename_find_replace.vbs

The script works in similar fashion as find-and-replace (CTRL+H)
function in e.g. Microsoft Windows Office applications for text.
In this case the script renames several files at once.

1. User is asked the location for modified files
2. User is asked what (sub)string is to be replaced
3. User is asked what string is to be used as replacement.

### print_movie_list_3.vbs

This is an improved version 3 of a script that prints out the contents
of a directory that contains movie files. The script handles now several
root directories and combines the results into a single output file (.CSV).
